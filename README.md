Theres more libraries at this point<br>

INSTALLATION:

1. Pull from Github (or clone or whatever just get all our code from github)

2. Choose 1 of the follwing options

OPTION 1 Using the ant and the build file to build a fresh jar <br>
Run the buildfile through eclipse or the commandline with the task "jar"

OPTION 2 Using the jar already made<br>
The latest output of running the task "jar" was pushed up for easy access.<br>
Look for the folder TeamCAsthmaGame.

3. Running!
There should be a folder called TeamCAsthmaGame. Inside is the jar called app.jar and all the resources needed to run.<br>
(PS you can move that folder anywhere on your computer, you need the folder and all its contents to run the program)<br>
Double click app.jar and use the following information to log in.<br>
username: grader@teamc.com<br>
password: teamc<br>
This will log you in as a doctor. Use your doctor status to create a patient and then you are able to login using<br>
the patient information you used.

TroubleShooting:<br>
If double clicking doesn't work<br>
Right click and use "open with" and select java.

If you don't have java<br>
Well idk man, surprised you got this far. You need more help<br>
then the troubleshooting offered here.
